List of Environment Wrappers:
- NoopResetWrapper: This wrapper facilitates the sampling of initial states by executing a random number of
    no-operation actions upon environment reset.
- MaxAndSkipWrapper: Incorporates max pooling across time steps, a method that reduces the temporal dimension by taking
    the maximum value over specified time intervals.
- WarpFrameWrapper: Implements frame warping by resizing the images to 84x84, a common preprocessing step in
    reinforcement learning on visual data, as described in the DeepMind Nature paper and subsequent works.
- ScaledFloatFrameWrapper: Normalizes observations to a range of 0 to 1, which is a common requirement for neural
    network inputs.
- ClipRewardWrapper: Clips the reward to {-1, 0, +1} based on its sign. This simplifies the reward structure and
    can make learning more stable in environments with high variance in rewards.
- DelayRewardWrapper: Returns cumulative reward at defined intervals, and at all other times, returns a reward of 0.
    This can be useful for sparse reward problems.
- FrameStackWrapper: Stacks the latest 'n' frames as a single observation. This allows the agent to have a sense of
    dynamics and motion from the stacked frames.
- ObsTransposeWrapper: Transposes the observation to bring the channel to the first dimension, a common requirement
    for convolutional neural networks.
- ObsNormWrapper: Normalizes observations based on a running mean and standard deviation. This can help to standardize
    inputs for the agent and speed up learning.
- RewardNormWrapper: Normalizes reward based on a running standard deviation, which can stabilize learning in
    environments with high variance in rewards.
- RamWrapper: Wraps a RAM-based environment into an image-like environment. This can be useful for applying
    image-based algorithms to RAM-based Atari games.
- EpisodicLifeWrapper: Treats end of life as the end of an episode, but only resets on true game over. This can help
    the agent better differentiate between losing a life and losing the game.
- FireResetWrapper: Executes the 'fire' action upon environment reset. This is specific to certain Atari games where
    the 'fire' action starts the game.
- GymHybridDictActionWrapper: Transforms the original `gym.spaces.Tuple` action space into a `gym.spaces.Dict`.
- FlatObsWrapper: Flattens image and language observations into a single vector, which can be helpful for input into
    certain types of models.
- StaticObsNormWrapper: Provides functionality for normalizing observations according to a static mean and
    standard deviation.
- EvalEpisodeReturnWrapper: Evaluates the return over an episode during evaluation, providing a more comprehensive
    view of the agent's performance.
- GymToGymnasiumWrapper: Adapts environments from the Gym library to be compatible with the Gymnasium library.
- AllinObsWrapper: Consolidates all information into the observation, useful for environments where the agent's
    observation should include additional information such as the current score or time remaining.
- ObsPlusPrevActRewWrapper: This wrapper is used in policy NGU. It sets a dict as the new wrapped observation,
    which includes the current observation, previous action and previous reward.

    Overview:
        The ActionRepeatWrapper class is a gym wrapper that repeats the same action for a number of steps.
        This wrapper is particularly useful in environments where the desired effect is achieved by maintaining
        the same action across multiple time steps. For instance, some physical environments like motion control
        tasks might require consistent force input to produce a significant state change.

        Using this wrapper can reduce the temporal complexity of the problem, as it allows the agent to perform
        multiple actions within a single time step. This can speed up learning, as the agent has fewer decisions
        to make within a time step. However, it may also sacrifice some level of decision-making precision, as the
        agent cannot change its action across successive time steps.

        Note that the use of the ActionRepeatWrapper may not be suitable for all types of environments. Specifically,
        it may not be the best choice for environments where new decisions must be made at each time step, or where
        the time sequence of actions has a significant impact on the outcome.

    Overview:
        The DelayRewardWrapper class is a gym wrapper that delays the reward. It cumulates the reward over a
        predefined number of steps and returns the cumulated reward only at the end of this interval.
        At other times, it returns a reward of 0.

        This wrapper is particularly useful in environments where the impact of an action is not immediately
        observable, but rather delayed over several steps. For instance, in strategic games or planning tasks,
        the effect of an action may not be directly noticeable, but it contributes to a sequence of actions that
        leads to a reward. In these cases, delaying the reward to match the action-effect delay can make the
        learning process more consistent with the problem's nature.

        However, using this wrapper may increase the difficulty of learning, as the agent needs to associate its
        actions with delayed outcomes. It also introduces a non-standard reward structure, which could limit the
        applicability of certain reinforcement learning algorithms.

        Note that the use of the DelayRewardWrapper may not be suitable for all types of environments. Specifically,
        it may not be the best choice for environments where the effect of actions is immediately observable and the
