   :maxdepth: 3


Here we show some key concepts about reinforcement learning training and evaluation pipeline designed by DI-engine.
One of the basic control flows(serial pipeline) can be described as:

   :align: center

In the following sections, DI-engine first introduces key concepts/components separately, then combines them like building
a special "Evolution Graph" to offer different computation patterns(serial, parallel, dist).

Concept
----------
``Environment`` and ``policy`` are the most two important concepts in the total design scheme, which can also be called description modules, in most cases, the users of DI-engine only need to pay
attention to these two components.

``Worker`` modules, such as ``learner``, ``collector``, and ``buffer``, are execution modules implementing the corresponding tasks derived from the description modules. These worker
modules are general in many RL algorithms, but the users can also override their components easily, the only restriction is to obey the basic interface definition.

Last but not least, ``config`` is the recommended tool to control and record the whole pipeline.

.. tip::
  Environment and policy are partially extended from the original definition in other RL papers and frameworks.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DI-engine environment is a superset of ``gym.Env``, it is compatible with gym env interfaces and offers some optional interfaces, e.g.: dynamic seed, collect/evaluate setting, `Env Overview <../feature/env_overview_en.html>`_

``EnvManager``, usually called Vectorized Environments in other frameworks, aims to implement parallel environment simulation to speed up data collection. Instead of interacting with 1 environment per collect step, it allows the collector to interact with N homogeneous environments per step, which means that ``action`` passed to ``env.step`` is a vector with a length of N, and the return value of ``env.step`` (obs, reward, done) is the same as it.

For the convenience of **asynchronous reset** and **unifying asynchronous/synchronous step**, DI-engine modifies the interface of env manager like this:

.. code:: python

   # DI-engine EnvManager                                                            # pseudo code in the other RL papers
   env.launch()                                                                   # obs = env.reset()
   while True:                                                                    # while True:
       obs = env.ready_obs                                                              
       action = random_policy.forward(obs)                                        #     action = random_policy.forward(obs)
       timestep = env.step(action)                                                #     obs_, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
       # maybe some env_id matching when enable asynchronous
       transition = [obs, action, timestep.obs, timestep.reward, timestep.done]    #     transition = [obs, action, obs_, reward, done]
                                                                                  #     if done:
                                                                                  #         obs[i] = env.reset(i)
       if env.done:                                                               #     if env.done  # collect enough env frames
           break                                                                  #         break

There are three types EnvManager in DI-engine now:

  - BaseEnvManager——**local test and validation**
  - SyncSubprocessEnvManager——parallel simulation for **low fluctuation environment**
  - AsyncSubprocessEnvManager——parallel simulation for **high fluctuation environment**

The following demo image shows the detailed runtime logics between ``BaseEnvManager`` and ``SyncSubprocessEnvManager``:

.. image::
   images/env_manager_base_sync.png

For the subprocess-type env manager, DI-engine uses shared memory among different worker subprocesses to save the cost of IPC, and `pyarrow <https://github.com/apache/arrow>`_ will be a reliable alternative in the following version.

.. note::
   If the environment is some kind of client, like SC2 and CARLA, maybe a new env manager based on python thread can be faster.

.. note::
   If there are some pre-defined neural networks in the environment using GPU, like the feature extractor VAE trained by self-supervised training before RL training, DI-engine recommends to utilize parallel executions in each subprocess rather than stack all the data in the main process and then forward this network. Moreover, it is not an elegant method, DI-engine will try to find some new flexible and general solution.

Besides, for robustness in practical usage, like IPC error(broken pipe, EOF) and environment runtime error, DI-engine also provides a series of **Error Tolerance** tools, e.g.: watchdog and auto-retry.

For all the mentioned features, the users can refer to `EnvManager Overview <../feature/env_manager_overview_en.html>`_ for more details.

Policy
~~~~~~~
To unify the design pattern and modularization of RL and other machine learning algorithms, DI-engine abstracts and defines the general policy interfaces with multi-mode design.
With these abstractions, plenty of the AI decision algorithms can be summarized in only one python file, i.e.: corresponding policy class. And the user's customized algorithms only need to inherit and extend :class:`Policy <ding.policy.Policy>` or just have the same interface definition with it. 

The Multi-Mode of Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In most cases, RL policy needs to execute different algorithm procedures for different usages, e.g.: for DQN, the model forward and calculating TD error in training,
the model forward without gradient computation and use epsilon-greedy to select actions for exploration in collecting. Therefore, DI-engine policy unifies all the algorithm content in only one python file,
prepares some simple interface methods, and combines them into 3 common modes——**learn_mode, collect_mode, eval_mode**, as is shown in the next image:

.. image::
   images/policy_mode.svg

Learn_mode aims to policy updating, collect_mode does proper exploration and exploitation to collect training data, eval_mode evaluates policy performance clearly and fairly. And the users can customize their
own algorithm ideas by overriding these modes or design their customized modes, such as hyperparameters annealing according to training result, select battle players in self-play training, and so on. For more details,
the users can refer to `Policy Overview <../feature/policy_overview_en.html>`_.

.. note::
   ``policy.learn_mode`` is not the instance of :class:`Policy <ding.policy.Policy>` but a pure interface collection(implemented by namedtuple), which means the users can implement their policy class just ensuring the same method names and input/output arguments as the corresponding modes.

Shared Model + Model Wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Neural network, often called model, is the one of most important components in the whole algorithm. For serial pipeline, the model is usually created in the public common constructor method(``__init__``) or out of policy and passed to the policy as arguments. Therefore, the model is shared among different modes for convenience. And DI-engine extends the model with more runtime function by ``Model Wrapper`` , which makes the shared model can exhibit different behaviors in different modes, such as sampling action by multinomial distribution in collect mode while :math:`argmax` in evaluating mode. Here are some concrete code examples:

.. code:: python

    from ding.model import model_wrap, DQN

    model = DQN(obs_shape=(4, 84, 84), action_shape=6)
    # only wrapper, no model copy
    learn_model = model_wrap(model_wrap, wrapper_name='base')
    collector_model = model_wrap(model, wrapper_name='multinomial_sample')
    eval_model = model_wrap(model, wrapper_name='argmax_sample')

If you want to know more about pre-defined models for each algorithms and customize you model, please refer to `Model Overview <../feature/model_overview_en.html>`_.

If you want to know about the detailed information of the pre-defined model wrapper or customize your model wrapper, `Wrapper Overview <../feature/wrapper_hook_overview_en.html>`_ can help you a lot.

Processing Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In practical algorithm implementations, the users often need to many data processing operations, like stacking several samples into a batch, data transformation between torch.Tensor and np.ndarray. As for RL
algorithms themselves, there are a great number of different styles of data pre-processing and aggregation, such as calculating N-step return and GAE(Generalized Advantage Estimation), split trajectories or unroll segments, and so on. Since then, DI-engine has provided some common processing functions, which can be called as a pure function. And the users can utilize these functions both in collect mode and in learning mode. 

For example, where should we calculate advantages for some on-policy algorithms, such as A2C/PPO, learn mode or collect mode? The former can distribute computation to different collector nodes in distributed
training for saving time, and the latter can usually gain better performance due to more accurate approximation, just a trade-off. For a framework, it is more wiser to offer some powerful and efficient tools rather
than restricting some fixed pipelines. The following table shows some existing processing functions and related information:


====================== ========================================== ==============================
Function Name          Description                                Path

Scale Up to Parallel Training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Config
~~~~~~~~~

key concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Config module is a component for users to determine what kind of parameters they want to use.
The overall design is as follows:

.. image:: images/config.png
   :alt: 

As you can see from above diagram, the entire config is mainly from two parts. One is called Default Config,
which is our recommended setting for policy and env, and may not change a lot. The other is called User Config,
which users may want to specify case by case.

In order to get the entire config, we have **compile** phase, a bottom-up process. First we get the default setting
for each submodule like Learner, Collector, etc. Then we put them together and get Default Config
for policy and env. Finally, we merge Default config with User Config and get the entire config.

On the other hand, **initialization** phase, the process to create modules according to config, is from top to bottom. We will start from
policy and env, and then pass configs to each execution modules.

In DI-engine, we write config as a python ``dict``. Below is an outline for Default Config.

.. code:: python

   cartpole_dqn_default_config = dict(
       env=dict(
           manager=dict(...),
           ...
       ),
       policy=dict(
           model=dict(...),
           collect=dict(...),
           learn=dict(...),
           eval=dict(...),
           other=dict(
               replay_buffer=dict(),
               ...
           ),
           ...
       ),
   )

config overview

In the following table, we list some commonly-used keys as well as their meanings.

Rules when merging user-specific config and predefined config:

-  User-specific config is of highest priority, which means that it will cover
   the predefined one when conflict occurs.

-  Some important keys, such as ``env.stop_value``, ``env.n_evaluator_episode``, ``policy.on_policy``,
   ``policy.collect.n_sample`` or ``policy.collect.n_episode``  must be specific.

-  The merged entire config will be saved to ``total_config.py`` and ``formatted_total_config.py``  by default.

.. _header-n125:

How to customize?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose we need to set key ``nstep`` mentioned above to 3, how to do it?

If the file name of user config is ``dqn_user_config.py``, just add the following code into User config.

.. code:: python

   policy=dict(
       ...,
       learn=dict(
           ...,
           nstep=3,
       )
   )

After writing the user config, we can run our DQN experiment according
to `Quick Start <../quick_start/index.html>`_.

Worker-Collector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Collector is one of the most important components among all the workers, which is often called ``actor`` in other frameworks and DI-engine renames it to distinguish with actor-critic. It aims to offer sufficient 
quantity and quality data for policy training (learner). And collector is only responsible for data collection but decoupled with data management, that is to say, it returns collected trajectories directly and 
these data can be used for training directly or pushed into replay buffer.

There are 3 core parts for a collector——env manager, policy(collect_mode), collector controller, and these parts can be implemented in a 
single process or located in several machines. Usually, DI-engine use a multi-process env_manager and another main loop controller process with policy to construct a collector, which may be extended in the future.

Due to different send/receive data logic, the collector now is divided into two patterns——serial and parallel, we will introduce them separately.

Serial Collector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the viewpoint of the basic unit of collecting data, sample(step) and episode are two mainly used types. Therefore, DI-engine defines the abstract interfaces ``ISerialCollector`` for a serial collector and 
implements ``SampleCollector`` and ``EpisodeCollector``, which covers almost RL usages but the users can also easily customize when encountering some special demands.

.. image::
   images/serial_collector_class.svg
   :align: center


The core usage of collector is quite simple, the users just need to create a corresponding type collector and indicate ``n_sample`` or ``n_episode`` as the argument of ``collect`` method. Here is a naive example:


.. code:: python

    import gym
    from easydict import EasyDict
    from ding.policy import DQNPolicy
    from ding.env import BaseEnvManager
    from ding.worker import SampleCollector, EpisodeCollector

    # prepare components
    cfg: EasyDict  # config after `compile_config`
    normal_env = BaseEnvManager(...)  # normal vectorized env
    
    dqn_policy = DQNPolicy(cfg.policy)
    sample_collector = SampleCollector(cfg.policy.collect.collector, normal_env, dqn_policy.collect_mode)
    episode_collector = EpisodeCollector(cfg.policy.collect.collector, normal_env, dqn_policy.collect_mode)

    # collect 100 train sample
    data = sample_collector.collect(n_sample=100)
    assert isinstance(data, list) and len(data) == 100
    assert all([isinstance(item, dict) for item in data])

    # collect 10 env episode
    episodes = episode_collector.collect(n_episode=10)
    assert isinstance(episodes, list) and len(episodes) == 10

    # push into replay buffer/send to learner/data preprocessing

.. note::
    For all cases, the number of collect data, n_sample/n_episode, is fixed in the total training procedure, so our example codes set this field in configs, such as ``config.policy.collect.n_sample``.


The structure and main loop of collector can be summarized as the next image, the interaction of policy and env consists of ``policy.forward``, ``env.step`` and the related support codes. Then ``policy.process_transition`` and
``policy.get_train_sample`` contributes to process data into training samples and pack them to a list. For ``EpisodeCollector``, which is usually used in some cases that need to do special post-processing, 
``policy.get_train_sample`` is disabled and the users can do anything after receiving the collected data.

.. image::
   images/collector_pipeline.svg
   :align: center

Sometimes, we use different policies even different envs to collect data, such as using random policy at the beginning of training to prepare warmup data, and calculate distillation loss with the probability of 
expert policy. And all the demands can be implemented by ``reset_policy``, ``reset_env``, ``reset`` method like this:

.. code:: python
   
    # prepare components
    dqn_policy = DQNPolicy(...)
    random_policy = RandomPolicy(...)
    expert_policy = ExpertPolicy(...)

    collector = SampleCollector(...)
    replay_buffer = NaiveBuffer(...)

    # train beginning(random_policy)
    collector.reset_policy(random_policy.collect_mode)
    random_data = collector.collect(n_sample=10000)
    replay_buffer.push(random_data)
    # main loop
    while True:
        ...
        collector.reset_policy(dqn_policy.collect_mode)
        data = collector.collect(n_sample=100)
        collector.reset_policy(expert_policy.collect_mode)
        expert_data = collector.collect(n_sample=100)
        # train dqn_policy with collected data
        ...


Besides, serial collector shows less difference between on-policy and off-policy algorithms, the only thing is to reset some statistics and temporal buffers, which can be automatically executed by collector, the 
users just need to ensure the correct value of ``config.policy.on_policy``.

Last, there are some other features such as collecting data with asynchronous env_manager, dealing with abnormal env steps, please refer to `Collector Overview <../feature/collector_overview_en.html>`_.

Parallel Collector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TBD

Worker-Buffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replay buffer is a component to store data collected by collector or generated by a fixed policy(usually expert policy), then provide data for the learner to optimize policy. In DI-engine, there are **three types of replay buffers**:

   - NaiveReplayBuffer
   - AdvancedReplayBuffer
   - EpisodeReplayBuffer

These three are all subclasses derived from abstract Interface ``IBuffer``.

.. image::
   images/buffer_class_uml.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

The key methods of a buffer are ``push`` and ``sample``. ``NaiveReplayBuffer`` is a simple FIFO queue implementation. It only provides basic functions of the two methods.

   1. ``push``: Push some collected data in the buffer. If exceeding the max size of the buffer, queue head data will be removed out of buffer.
   2. ``sample``: Uniformly sample a list with length `batch_size` by random.

Based on ``NaiveReplayBuffer``, ``AdvancedReplayBuffer`` and ``EpisodeReplayBuffer`` respectively implements more functions and features.

``AdvancedReplayBuffer`` implements the following features: (Also shown in the figure)

   - **Prioritized Sampling**. Completely implement paper `Prioritized Experience Replay <https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952>`_
   - **Monitor data quality(use_count and staleness)**. If a piece of data is used too many times or is too stale to optimize policy, it will be removed out of the buffer.

   .. note::
      **use_count**: Count how many times a piece of data is sampled. 

      **staleness**: Model iteration gap between the time when it is collected and the time when it is sampled
   
   - **Throughput monitor and control**. In a fixed period, count how many pieces of data are pushed into, sampled out of, removed out of the buffer. Control the ratio "Pushed in" / "Sampled out" in a range, in case the dataflow speed does not match.
   - **Logger**. Sampled data attributes and throughput are shown in text logger and tensorboard logger.

.. image::
   images/advanced_buffer.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 65%
   

.. tip::
   By default, most policies in DI-engine adopt ``AdvancedReplayBuffer``, because we think monitor and logger are rather important in debugging and policy tuning. However, if you are sure that you do not need all the features above, you can feel free to switch to simpler and faster ``NaiveReplayBuffer``.

``EpisodeReplayBuffer`` is designed for some special cases where they need a whole episode rather than separated samples. For example: In chess, go or card games, players get reward only when the game is over; In some algorithms like `Hindsight Experience Replay <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495>`_, must sample out a whole episode and operate on it. Therefore, in ``EpisodeReplayBuffer``, each element is no longer a training sample, but an episode.

In DI-engine, we define **full data** and **meta data**. **Full data** is often a dict, with keys ``['obs', 'action', 'next_obs', 'reward', 'info']`` and some optional keys like ``['priority', 'use_count', 'collect_iter', ...]``. However, in some complex environments(Usually we run them in parallel mode), ``['obs', 'action', 'next_obs', 'reward', 'info']`` can be too big to store in memory. Therefore, we store them in file system, and only store **meta data** including ``'file_path'`` and optional keys in memory. Therefore, in parallel mode, when removing the data out of buffer, we must not only remove meta data in memory but also remove that in the file system as well.

If you want to know more details about the three types of replay buffers, or the remove mechanism in parallel mode, please refer to `Replay Buffer Overview <../feature/replay_buffer_overview_en.html>`_

Worker-Evaluator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evaluator, another key execution component of DI-engine, is used to determine whether the training model is convergent
or not. Similar to collector, evaluator consists of three key components ——env manager, policy(eval_mode), evaluator
controller.

Env manager allow us to run multiple environments one by one(``base_env_manager`) or in parallel
(``subprocess_env_manager``). For example, if we use subprocess env manager, we will run different environments
in different subprocesses, which will greatly increase the efficiency of collecting episodes.

Policy(eval_mode) is the rl model which we need to check.

Evaluator controller is a component to determine if we should stop evaluating or not. For example, in ``Serial
Evaluator``, ``n_evaluator_episode`` is an argument to determine how many episodes we want to collect and evaluate. Once
we collect these number of episodes, evaluator will stop collecting and start to compute the average reward. If the average
is larger than ``stop_value``, ``stop_flag`` will be True, and we will know our model is already convergent.

Serial Evaluator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Serial evaluator is used in serial pipeline. Key concepts are ``n_evaluator_episode`` and ``stop_value``, which has been
explained above.

The following is an example of how to use serial evaluator:

.. code:: python

    import gym
    from easydict import EasyDict
    from ding.policy import DQNPolicy
    from ding.env import BaseEnvManager
    from ding.worker import BaseSerialEvaluator

    # prepare components
    cfg: EasyDict  # config after `compile_config`
    normal_env = BaseEnvManager(...)  # normal vectorized env
    
    dqn_policy = DQNPolicy(cfg.policy)
    evaluator = BaseSerialEvaluator(cfg.policy.eval.evaluator, normal_env, dqn_policy.eval_mode)

    # evalulate 10 env episode
    stop, reward = evaluator.eval(learner.save_checkpoint, learner.train_iter, collector.envstep, n_episode=10)
    assert isinstance(reward, list) and len(reward) == 10

    # judge whether the return value reaches the convergence standard
    if stop:
       break

.. note::
   Different environments may have different  ``stop_value`` and ``n_evaluator_episode``. For example, in cartpole,
   we have``stop_value=195`` and ``n_evaluator_episode=100``. Users should indicate these two arguments in ``env``
   config(i.e. ``env.stop_value``, ``env.n_evaluator_episode``), and then they will be passed to evaluator.


Combined with the evaluation condition(i.e. ``should_eval`` method), We can add the evaluator into the serial pipeline as follows:

.. code:: python

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        
        # Evaluate policy performance
        if evaluator.should_eval(learner.train_iter):
            #load model
            stop, reward = evaluator.eval(learner.save_checkpoint, learner.train_iter, collector.envstep)
            # if stop flag, exit the process
            if stop:
                break
            # if not stop flag, continue to collect data and train the model
            new_data = collector.collect(train_iter=learner.train_iter, policy_kwargs=collect_kwargs)


.. tip::
   **How to judge whether the model converges or not?**

   We judge whether the model converges or not based on average reward. In DI-engine, there are three types of average
   reward: winning probability, total cumulative reward and average unit step reward.

   Winning probability: In games like ``SMAC``, we focus on the final result and don't care too much about the
   game process. For such environments, we use winning probability(for ``SMAC`` 1.0 in 3s5z) as the convergence condition.

   Total cumulative reward: In games like ``cartpole`` and ``lunarlander``, we need to make the total score as large as
   possible. So we use total cumulative reward as the convergence condition.

   Average unit step reward: In some games, we need to make the total reward as large as possible and reduce the number
   of unnecessary exploration steps in the meantime. For such environments, we use average unit step reward as the
   convergence condition.

   Besides, a reliable RL experiment should be repeated 3~5 times with different random seeds, and some statistics
   such as the median value and the mean/std value can be more convincing.


.. tip::

   **How to solve the problem that different environment in evaluator may collect different length episode?**
   
   In some cases, this is really a big problem. For example, suppose we want to collect 12 episodes in evaluator
   but only have 5 environments, if we didn't do any thing, it is likely that we will get more short episodes than long
   episodes. As a result, our average reward will have a bias and may not be accurate. This is obvious since short
   episodes need less time.

   In order to solve such problem, we use ``VectorEvalMonitor``, a component to balance how many episodes to collect
   per environment. Let's go back to the above example, we will collect three episodes for either of the first two
   environments but only two for each of the remaining environments.

   Besides, we use ``get_episode_reward`` to get the sum of the rewards of k episodes in each environment, and
   ``get_current_episode`` to get the episode num k in each environment.


Worker-Learner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Learner is one of the most important components among all the workers, who is reponsible for optimizing the policy by training data. Unlike another important component ``Collector``, learner is not divided into serial and parralel modes, i.e. There is only one learner class, serial and parallel entry can call different methods for training.

**Serial pipeline** would call learner's ``train`` method for training. ``train`` method receives a batch of data, and call learn_mode policy's ``_forward_learn`` to train for one iteraton.

**Parallel pipeline** would call learner's ``start`` method for a complete process of training. ``start`` method has a loop, which includes fetching data from source(Often file system), and calling ``train`` for one-iteration training. ``start`` will train for a specific number of iterations, which is set by use config.

Besides ``train`` and ``start``, learner also provides a useful interface called ``save_checkpoint``, which can save current state_dict as a checkpoint during training.

In learner, there is a special concept called ``Hook``. Hook is responsible for doing some fixed jobs at specific timings, including "before_run"(at the beginning of ``start`` ), "after_run"(at the ending of ``start`` ), "before_iter"(at the beginning of ``train`` ), "after_iter"(at the ending of ``train`` ).

Hook has many different types. DI-engine now has hooks to save checkpoint( ``save_checkpoint`` also uses this hook), load checkpoint, print log(text & tb), reduce log from multiple learners. Users can also implement their own hooks easily. If you want to know more about hook mechanism, you can refer to `Wrapper & Hook Overview <../feature/wrapper_hook_overview_en.html>`_.

For more details about learner, please refer to `Learner Overview <../feature/learner_overview_en.html>`_.

Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DI-engine offers 3 training entries for different usage, users can choose any one they like:

    1. CLI
        
        **Simply run a training program, validate correctness, acquire RL model or expert data.**

        .. code:: bash

            # usage 1(without config)
            ding -m serial --env cartpole --policy dqn --train_iter 100000 -s 0
            # usage 2(with config)
            ding -m serial -c cartpole_dqn_config.py -s 0

        You can refer to `CLI Overview <../feature/cli_overview_en.html>`_ for more details.
        
    2. Customized Main Function

        **Customize you RL training pipeline, design algorithm or apply it in your environment.**

        refer to some example main function python file in ``app_zoo/envname/entry/envname_policyname_main.py`` , such as:

            - app_zoo/classic_control/cartpole/entry/cartpole_dqn_main.py
            - app_zoo/classic_control/cartpole/entry/cartpole_ppo_main.py
            - app_zoo/classic_control/pendulum/entry/pendulum_td3_main.py

        .. code:: bash

            python3 -u cartpole_dqn_main.py  # users can also add arguments list in your own entry file

    3. Unified Entry Function

        **Config-mode entry, just adjust hyper-parameters and do comparsion experiements in the existing algorithms and pipelines.** 

        .. code:: python

            from ding.entry import serial_pipeline
            from app_zoo.classic_control.cartpole.config.cartpole_dqn_config import main_config, create_config
            serial_pipeline([main_config, create_config], seed=0)

        You can refer to ``ding/entry`` directory and read related entry functions and tests.
