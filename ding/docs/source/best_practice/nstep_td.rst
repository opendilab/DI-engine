N-step TD
=========

**1. What is n-step TD**

n-step TD lies between Monte Carlo and TD methods. Consider estimating :math:`v_\pi` from
episodes generated from :math:`\pi`, Monte Carlo performs an update based on the entire
sequence while one-step TD is based on one next reward, bootstrapping from the value of the
state one step later. n-step TD is the intermediate method, which performs an update based
on an intermediate number of rewards, which is more than one but less than all of them.

More formally, consider the update of state :math:`S_t` with the sequence,
:math:`S_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, R_{t+2}, ..., R_{T}, S_{T}`. Monte Carlo is updated in the complete
return:

    :math:`G_{t} = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ... +\gamma^{T-t-1} R_{T}`

where T is the last time step of the episode. And we have one-step TD return:

    :math:`G_{t:t+1} = R_{t+1} + \gamma V_{t}(S_{t+1})`

Accordingly, we have n-step TD return:

    :math:`G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ... +\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V_{t+n-1}(S_{t+n})`

**2. How to enable nstep-TD in DI-engine**

DI-engine has provided n-step implementation and enable it in a lot of algorithms, like DQN, A2C, etc.
Here, we will introduce how to enable nstep-td and modify the code. Takes DQN as an example, if we
wanna enable nstep=3, we should set the config as follows:

.. code:: python

 config = dict(
        type='dqn',
        cuda=False,
        on_policy=False,
        priority=False,
        discount_factor=0.97,
        # (int) N-step reward for target q_value estimation
        nstep=3,
        ...,)

**3. How does it work in DI-engine**

Takes DQN as an example again. We set the propoerty according to the config in ``_init_collect`` and
``_init_learn`` function in the corresponding policy. Here we show the code of DQN as follows,

.. code:: python

    def _init_collect(self) -> None:
        ...,
        self._nstep = self._cfg.nstep
        ...,

.. code:: python

    def _init_learn(self) -> None:
        ...,
        self._nstep = self._cfg.nstep
        ...,

Then, we organize the rewards and value data for n-step return in ``_get_train_sample`` function.

.. code:: python

    def _get_train_sample(self, data: deque) -> Union[None, List[Any]]:
        ...,
        if self._nstep_return:
            data = self._adder.get_nstep_return_data(data, self._nstep)
        ...,
        return self._adder.get_train_sample(data)

Next, we actually calculate n-step return in ``_forward_learn`` function

.. code:: python

    def _forward_learn(self, data: dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:

        ...,
        data_n = q_nstep_td_data(
            q_value, target_q_value, data['action'], target_q_action, data['reward'], data['done'], data['weight']
        )
        value_gamma = data.get('value_gamma')
        loss, td_error_per_sample = q_nstep_td_error(data_n, self._gamma, nstep=self._nstep, value_gamma=value_gamma)
        ...,

The calculation is implemented in ``q_nstep_td_error`` function

Please notice that the key ``nstep`` might be in different positions for different algorithm.

We also provide some other n-sted td methods, please refer to ``ding\rl_utils\td.py``.
