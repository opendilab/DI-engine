As kickoff, we will illustrate how to launch a RL experiment on a simple ``CartPole`` environment (as shown in above figure) using DI-engine.


Concretely, we will define a training pipeline in a single python file that specifies the training hyper-parameters, sampling and evaluation environments, the neural networks for the RL agents, as well as the training workflow.

Instantiate the run-time config
-------------------------------

The first step to build a training workflow is to specify the training configuration.
DI-engine prefers a nested python dict object to represent all parameters and configurations of an RL experiment, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    cartpole_dqn_config = dict(
        env=dict(
            collector_env_num=8,
            evaluator_env_num=5,
        ),
        policy=dict(
            model=dict(
                encoder_hidden_size_list=[128, 128, 64],
            ),
            discount_factor=0.97,
        ),
        ......
    )

.. note ::

    For the specific example, you can refer to:

      - config:  ``dizoo/classic_control/cartpole/config/cartpole_dqn_config.py``
      - main: ``dizoo/classic_control/cartpole/entry/cartpole_dqn_main.py``

    **and you just need to run this experiment following the next command:**

    .. code:: bash

        python3 -u dizoo/classic_control/cartpole/entry/cartpole_dqn_main.py

DI-engine provides default configs for all modules, and also a helper function ``compile_config`` to merge the default configs of these modules into a run-time config object (a ``EasyDict`` object that can be accessed by string key ``cfg["env"]`` or attribute ``cfg.env``):

.. code-block:: python

    from ding.config import compile_config
    from ding.envs import BaseEnvManager, DingEnvWrapper
    from ding.model import DQN
    from ding.policy import DQNPolicy
    from ding.worker import BaseLearner, SampleCollector, BaseSerialEvaluator, AdvancedReplayBuffer
    from dizoo.classic_control.cartpole.config.cartpole_dqn_config import cartpole_dqn_config

    # compile config
    cfg = compile_config(
        cartpole_dqn_config,
        BaseEnvManager,
        DQNPolicy,
        BaseLearner,
        SampleCollector,
        BaseSerialEvaluator,
        AdvancedReplayBuffer,
        save_cfg=True
    )

In this example, we only present the procedure to specify config in the entry file. In the following section, we construct the RL pipeline in the same entry file based on the specified config.

Please note that DI-engine also supports running a RL experiment directly according to a given config file, e.g. 

.. code:: bash

    ding -m serial -c cartpole_dqn_config.py -s 0

For more design details, please refer to the `Config <../key_concept/index.html#config>`_ section and `Entry <../key_concept/index.html#entry>`_.


Initialize the Environments
---------------------------

The RL agents interact with the environment to collect training data or test its performance.
DI-engine provides enhanced RL environment interfaces derived from the widely used `OpenAI Gym <https://github.com/openai/gym>`_. 
You can simply wrap the gym environment into DI-engine environment by using the environment warpper :class:`DingEnvWrapper <ding.env.DingEnvWrapper>`.
You can also construct a more complex environment class following the guidelines in `Environment <../key_concept/index.html#env>`_ section.

The :class:`Env Manager <ding.envs.BaseEnvManager>` is used to manage multiple environments, single-process serially 
or multi-process parallelly. The interfaces of `env manager` are similar to those of a simple gym env. Here we show a case
of using :class:`BaseEnvManager <ding.envs.BaseEnvManager>` to build environments for collection and evaluation.

.. code-block:: python

    import gym

    def wrapped_cartpole_env():
        return DingEnvWrapper(gym.make('CartPole-v0'))

    collector_env_num, evaluator_env_num = cfg.env.collector_env_num, cfg.env.evaluator_env_num
    collector_env = BaseEnvManager(env_fn=[wrapped_cartpole_env for _ in range(collector_env_num)], cfg=cfg.env.manager)
    evaluator_env = BaseEnvManager(env_fn=[wrapped_cartpole_env for _ in range(evaluator_env_num)], cfg=cfg.env.manager)

Set up the Policy and NN models
-------------------------------

DI-engine supports most of the common policies used in RL training. Each is defined as a :class:`Policy <ding.policy.CommonPolicy>`
class. The details of optimiaztion algorithm, data pre-processing and post-processing, control of multiple networks 
are encapsulated inside. Users only need to build a PyTorch network structure and pass into the policy. 
DI-engine also provides default networks to simply apply to the environment. For some complex RL methods, it is required to set some
properties (such as ``Actor`` and ``Critic``) in your defined model.

For example, a ``DQN`` policy for ``CartPole`` can be defined as follow.

.. code-block:: python

    model = DQN(**cfg.policy.model)
    policy = DQNPolicy(cfg.policy, model=model)


Define the Execution Modules
----------------------------

DI-engine needs to build some execution components to manage an RL training procedure. 
A :class:`Collector <ding.worker.collector.SampleCollector>` is used to sample and provide data for training.
A :class:`Learner <ding.worker.learner.BaseLearner>` is used to receive training data and conduct 
the training (including updating networks, strategy and experience pool, etc.).
An :class:`Evaluator <ding.worker.collector.BaseSerialEvaluator>` is build to perform the evaluation when needed.
And other components like :class:`Replay Buffer <ding.worker.replay_buffer.AdvancedReplayBuffer>` may be required for the
training process. All these module can be customized by config or rewritten by the user.

An example of setting up all the above is showed as follow.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from tensorboardX import SummaryWriter    

    tb_logger = SummaryWriter(os.path.join('./log/', 'your_experiment_name'))
    learner = BaseLearner(cfg.policy.learn.learner, policy.learn_mode, tb_logger)
    collector = SampleCollector(cfg.policy.collect.collector, collector_env, policy.collect_mode, tb_logger)
    evaluator = BaseSerialEvaluator(cfg.policy.eval.evaluator, evaluator_env, policy.eval_mode, tb_logger)
    replay_buffer = AdvancedReplayBuffer(cfg.policy.other.replay_buffer, tb_logger)

Aggregate the Training and Evaluation Pipelines
-----------------------------------------------

The training loop in DI-engine can be customized arbitrarily. Usually the training process may consist of
collecting data, updating policy, updating related modules and evaluation.

Here we provide examples of off-policy training (``DQN``) for a ``CartPole`` environment. For more algorithms, you can refer to dizoo.

.. code-block:: python

    from ding.rl_utils import get_epsilon_greedy_fn
    
    # DQN training loop
    eps_cfg = cfg.policy.other.eps
    epsilon_greedy = get_epsilon_greedy_fn(eps_cfg.start, eps_cfg.end, eps_cfg.decay, eps_cfg.type)
    max_iterations = int(1e8)
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        if evaluator.should_eval(learner.train_iter):
            stop, reward = evaluator.eval(learner.save_checkpoint, learner.train_iter, collector.envstep)
            if stop:
                break
        eps = epsilon_greedy(collector.envstep)
        new_data = collector.collect(train_iter=learner.train_iter, policy_kwargs={'eps': eps})
        replay_buffer.push(new_data, cur_collector_envstep=collector.envstep)
        for i in range(cfg.policy.learn.update_per_collect):
            train_data = replay_buffer.sample(learner.policy.get_attribute('batch_size'), learner.train_iter)
            if train_data is not None:
                learner.train(train_data, collector.envstep)

Other Utilities
------------------

DI-engine supports various useful tools in common RL training, as shown in follows.

Epsilon Greedy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An easy way of deploying epsilon greedy exploration when sampling data has already been shown above. It is
called by the ``epsilon_greedy`` function each step. And you can select your own decay strategy, such as envstep and train_iter.

.. code-block:: python

    from ding.rl_utils import get_epsilon_greedy_fn
    
    eps_cfg = cfg.policy.other.eps
    epsilon_greedy = get_epsilon_greedy_fn(eps_cfg.start, eps_cfg.end, eps_cfg.decay, eps_cfg.type)
    while True:
        eps = epsilon_greedy(learner.train_iter)
        ...


Visualization & Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some environments have a renderd surface or visualization. DI-engine adds a switch to save these replays.
After training, the users need to indicate ``env.replay_path`` and ``policy.learn.learner.load_path`` in config,
and add the next lines after training converge. If everything is working fine, you can find some videos with '.mp4' suffix in the replay_path(some GUI interfaces are normal).

.. code-block:: python

    evaluator_env = BaseEnvManager(env_fn=[wrapped_cartpole_env for _ in range(evaluator_env_num)], cfg=cfg.env.manager)
    cfg.env.replay_path = './video'
    evaluator_env.enable_save_replay(cfg.env.replay_path)
    evaluator = BaseSerialEvaluator(cfg.policy.eval.evaluator, evaluator_env, policy.eval_mode, tb_logger)
    evaluator.eval(learner.save_checkpoint, learner.train_iter, collector.envstep)

.. tip::

    If users encounter some errors in recording videos by gym wrapper, you should install ``ffmpeg`` first.


Similar with other Deep Learning platforms, DI-engine uses tensorboard to record key parameters and results during
training. In addition to the default logging parameters, users can add their own logging parameters as follow.

.. code-block:: python

    tb_logger.add_scalar('epsilon_greedy', eps, learner.train_iter)

If you want to know more details about default information recorded in tensorboard, see our 
`tensorboard and logging demo <./tb_demo.html>`_ for a
DQN experiment.

Loading & Saving checkpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is usually needed to save and resume an experiments with model checkpoints. DI-engine saves and loads checkpoints
in the same way as PyTorch.

.. code-block:: python

    ckpt_path = 'path/to/your/ckpt'
    state_dict = torch.load(ckpt_path, map_location='cpu')
    learner.policy.load_state_dict(state_dict)
    learner.info('{} load ckpt in {}'.format(learner.name, ckpt_path))
    
    ...

    dirname = './ckpt_{}'.format(learner.name)
    os.mkdir(dirname, exsit_ok=True)
    ckpt_name = 'iteration_{}.pth.tar'.format(learner.last_iter.val)
    path = os.path.join(dirname, ckpt_name)
    state_dict = learner.policy.state_dict()
    torch.save(state_dict, path)
    learner.info('{} save ckpt in {}'.format(learner.name, path))

To deploy this in a more elegant way, DI-engine is configured to use 
:class:`Learner Hooks <ding.worker.learner.learner_hook.LearnerHook>` to handle these cases. The saving hook is 
automatically frequently called after training iterations. And to load & save checkpoints at the beginning and 
in the end, users can simply add one line code before & after training as follow.

.. code-block:: python
    
    learner.call_hook('before_run')

    # training loop
    while True:
        ...
    
    learner.call_hook('after_run')

For more information, please take a look to `Wrapper & Hook Overview <../feature/wrapper_hook_overview.html>`_ doc.
